While ACT had impresive success in New York and Chicago under the young organizers Jesse Gray and Lawrence Landry, the Washington chapter had able leadership under Julius Hobson.  Hobson focused the chapters roughly 2,000 members on school reform, police brutality, and governance issues.  ACT's  protests and lawsuits forced the police department to institute a Civilian Complaint Review Board and the school board to pay more attention to the needs of poor black students.  Though dynamic and effective, ACT never developed a robust membership and democratic decision making process and often operated at the personal whim of its founder, Hobson.  As a result, when Hobson turned his attention to the the famed Hobson v. Hansen lawsuit (1967) and ran for school board in 1968, the organization declined.",

The Benning Rd. line was a major thoroughfare for the majority black, east side of the city and was the most heavily travelled. Though the catalyst for the boycott was a proposed fare hike, SNCC activist Marion Barry and his advisor L.D. Pratt hoped to use the event to give black Washingtonians \"some faith in their own power\" thereby providing the needed \"momentum for an action organization dedicated to self government in the District.\"  The boycott was successful, decreasing ridership by 75,000 and forcing the bus company to roll back the proposed fare increase.  As planned, SNCC activists used the momentum from the boycott to found the Free DC movement on February 22, 1966.",

      "Description" : "Seeking to break Board of Trade opposition to D.C. self-determination, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Coalition of Concience (a coalition of religious and civil rights organizations) canvassed D.C. small businesses (principally in black commercial districts) asking them to support home rule, and threating to boycott those that refused.  Those businesses that added their name to the Free DC petition recieved orange and black \"Free DC - Right to Vote\" posters.  Marion Barry, who lead the campaign, also asked a small number of businesses to contribute to Free D.C. in February 1966, a tactic that lead to charges of bribery from opponents and discomfort among supporters like the Coalition of Concience and the NAACP.  Barry ceased the requests in light of the controversey, but the charges of bribery dogged the campaign for the remainder of its existence.  Aside from canvassing businesses, Free DC held summer block parties for the purpose of educating residents about the need for home rule.  Though the campaign faded by summer 1966, it had succeeded in getting roughly 700 small businesses and 40 larger concerns to disavow the Board of Trade's opposition to home rule and educated large swaths of the black community on the issue.

      "Description" : "During the first quarter, a small group of faculty created a proposal advocating that all students be required to take courses \"designed to deal with imbedded racial prejudices.\"  The Provost rejected it.  In response, these professors created a working group for the purpose of creating a Black Studies Department.  The group was headed by creative writing professor, James Garrett.  The proposal was utterly audacious and overtly political.  It called for a 4-year program with a separate college structure and degree granting privileges.  This college of Black Studies would be huge, commanding as many as half of the faculty positions at FCC. The authors of the proposal acknowledged its hybrid academic/activist slant in their proposal, writing, \"… the Program is at once a cultural and educational vehicle for creative awareness, confidence, and determination of Black people.\"  Specifically, the first two years of the degree program would be devoted to \"the decolonization of the mind of the student and the development of interpretive skills necessary to define… the relations between our history as a people and our present situation.\"  The second two years would be focused on acquiring the technical skills that students would need to help the black community – at home, in the Diaspora, and in Africa.  Early in the third quarter (January and February, 1969) the FCC faculty accepted the proposal, thereby creating the Black Studies Department, though the following May, amidst Congressional disapporoval and several firings of FCC administrators, Garrett announced that he was withdrawing the Black Studies proposal.  Calling FCC a \"plantation,\" Garrett stated that staying on campus put the \"minds of black people\" in the hands of Congress.  Determined to claim \"independence,\" he announced that the Black education program would leave FCC and set itself up in the \"community.\"",
