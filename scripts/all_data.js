It remained a small operation until the advent of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.  In 1963, when James G. Banks took over, it had a $35,000 budget and one full-time employee.  Two years later, after the Office of Economic Opportunity director, Sergeant Shriver began funnelling federal grants to the group, it had a buget of $21 million and 1,100 employees who coordinated planning of human service needs and facilities in the Washington, DC area.  Using these federal funds, and prodded by local activist Julius Hobson, the UPO found creative ways to involve poor people in anti-poverty programs.  After 1965, Banks hired a number of civil rights and black power activists, making the organization a hotbed of black power activism in the later half of the decade.  Though some activists grumbled that UPO money distorted the movement by \"buying off\" community members, UPO gave poor people both resources and a measure of administrative control, encouraging them to develop their own sense of power. By 1968, more than 1,500 low-income residents, many of them women, served in administrative and advisory positions through the UPO and other community action programs in D.C. \"No longer meek recipients of handouts,\" the Post's William Raspberry wrote in 1967, \"they bec[a]me vocal, insistent and demanding.",

Hobson focused the chapter's members on school reform, police brutality, and governance issues.  ACT's  protests and lawsuits forced the police department to institute a Civilian Complaint Review Board and the School Board to pay more attention to the needs of poor black students.  Though dynamic and effective, DC ACT never developed a robust membership or democratic decision making process and often operated at the personal whim of its founder, Hobson.  As a result, when Hobson turned his attention to the the famed Hobson v. Hansen lawsuit (1967) and ran for school board in 1968, the organization declined.",

Those businesses that added their name to the Free DC petition recieved orange and black \"Free DC - Right to Vote\" posters.  Marion Barry, who lead the campaign, also asked a small number of businesses to contribute to Free D.C. in February 1966, a tactic that lead to charges of bribery from opponents and discomfort among supporters like the Coalition of Conscience and the NAACP.  Barry ceased the requests in light of the controversy, but the charges of bribery dogged the campaign for the remainder of its existence.  Aside from canvassing businesses, Free DC held summer block parties for the purpose of educating residents about the need for home rule.  Though the campaign faded by summer 1966, it had succeeded in getting roughly 700 small businesses and 40 larger concerns to disavow the Board of Trade's opposition to home rule and in educating large swaths of the black community on the issue.

The New School offered classes in black history, arts, African languages, writing, sewing, and first aid to residnets of Shaw, Columbia Heights and the sourounding neighborhoods, all for free.  Some 400 residnets took advantage.  The Center was perhaps best known for the protest actions and concerts that organizers staged right outside their 14th St. storefront.  The New School hosted concerts by jazz impressario Sun Ra and poetry readings by Amiri Baraka, and activits staged sit down strikes in the intersetion of 14th and U and and a rally on 14th street, both to protest police brutality.  Stokely Charmichael also used the New School as the office for his Black United Front in 1968.  Following years of ideological dispute, money troubles, and government harassment, the New School closed in 1971. But before doing so, it influenced the formation of groups like the Center for Black Eductaion and Drum and Spear Bookstore, making it arguably one of the most important and influential black power organizations in the city.

In early 1966, members transformed themselves into the Rebels and demanded recreation improvements at the Barrm Farm housing project from the National Capital Housing Authority, then run by Walter Washington.  Later that year, many members of the group were hired by UPO to run youth programs in Anacostia after they stormed the UPO office demanding funds.  By 1967 the Rebels had suceeded in creating a tutoring program for drop-outs, securing money for the Douglass swimming pool and recreation ceter, improving lighting at area parks, improving city sanitation services, and getting the city to initiate traffic calming meaures in their neighborhoods.  By early 1967, their model of youth community organizing was being reproduced across the city using War on Poverty dollars.   ",

The officers arrested Foote on week-old charges of assault against a white man outside the 1023 Club, a local establishment poular with whites, many of who then lived in Maryland.  When another youth activist demanded to know why Foote was being arrested, police charged him with obstruction and arrested him as well.  Southeast House activist Will Michaels observed that the arrests, and claims that they had angered the other young men in the meeting and several neighbors who had gathered.  Determined to channel their anger into what he believed would be a productive, as opposed to violent, protest, Michaels encouraged the youth to  picket at the 11th precinct station house where the young men had been taken for processing.  He arranged transporttaion to the station and provided some protesting youth with signs reading: \"Lawful Assembly Denied,\" and \"Police Abuse.\" The demonstration began with teenagers marching peacefully in front of the police station but developed into what the local paper called \"a rock-throwing rampage.\" UPO leaders placed the blame for the escalation on the Metropolitan Police who called in a private security firm that used dogs to menace the protesters and charged the protesters using riot gear and a patrol car. One officer was injured and ten protesters were arrested in the three-hour conflict (roughly 9:30pm - 12:20am).  A citizen's commission was impaneled to study the incident and Police Commissioner Walter Tobriner promised not to use police dogs in the Anacostia  and Congress Heights communities in the future.  In the wake of the violence and resulting police scrutiny, Southeast House cleared its employees of wrongdoing in an internal investigation but decided to \"deemphasize direct action,\" in the words of director Ralph Fertig.",

Local activists hoped to repurpose some of the land on the base for low income housing, but members of the House Armed Services Committee voted to block any effort to repurpose the base for low income housing construction.  The protest was a direct reaction to the vote.  Determined not to have an incident at the base, the commanding office, Lt. Col. Stanley Nixon, invited the protesters onto the base for a tour.  At the end of the tour Walter Fauntroy raised a DC flag on an empty flag pole near the Anacoatia River.  Later in the day a small group of protesters lead by Rev.

    "Description": "Pride Inc. was a job training, business development, and self-help program founded by Curtis \"Catfish\" Mayfield, Mary Treadwell, and Marion Barry. The project first recieved funding in summer 1967, when Labor Secretary Wilard Wirtz gave the trio a $300,000 grant to run a work program for black youth in order to keep them off the streets (and avoid violence) that August.  Wearing dark green denim uniforms, the \"dudes,\" as they were called, fanned out across the city, cleaning up garbage, killing rats, and beautifying neglected neighborhoods.  When the the pilot program ended that September the founders capitalized on positive press coverage to push for year-round funding and Wirtz responded by giving them a $2 million grant.  In the years ahead Pride would grow into the second most formidable War on Poverty Program in the city (UPO remained larger) and a power base for Marion Barry who ousted Mayfield in a 1967 power struggle.  As it expanded, Pride built several businesses (a landscapeing service and several gas stations being its most well known), aquired low-income housing, and came to excercise a potent political presence in the Shaw / Columbia Heights neighborhoods where it was based.  Denigrated by conservatives and local white critics from the begining, Pride was subject to countless investigations.  Conservative congressmen tried to link Pride to the Mafia, Red China, H. Rap Brown, and drug pushers among other nefarious figures.  The Evening Star noted that it was \"one of the most investigated projects the government has ever undertaken.\"  The early investigations found only minor accounting irregularities and some poor business decisions.  By the early 1980s, however, Treadwell had begun to embezzel money from the Pride-owned Clifton Terrace house project.  She was convicted of the crime in 1984 and Pride subsequently folded.",

    "Description": "Federal City College (FCC) opened in the Fall of 1968 with a mission of helping its students and the DC community to \"rehumanize the city\" by exploring and finding answers to the problems associated with ‘the ghetto.' (is this an excerpted quote?) Over 6,000 students applied for admission to FCC in 1967-8.  Having only prepared for 1,300 students, the school selected applicants using a lottery system and rushed to secure a supplemental appropriation from Congress for an additional 1,100 students – which they received.  \n\nWhen the lottery was over the student body was 98% DC residents, 95% black, 66% non-traditional students (though the average age was 21), and 60% full time workers.  the first quarter, a small group of faculty created a proposal advocating that all students be required to take courses \"designed to deal with imbedded racial prejudices.\"  The Provost rejected it.  In response, these professors created a working group for the purpose of creating a Black Studies Department.  The group was headed by creative writing professor, James Garrett.  The proposal was utterly audacious and overtly political.  It called for a 4-year program with a separate college structure and degree granting privileges.  This college of Black Studies would be huge, commanding as many as half of the faculty positions at FCC. The authors of the proposal acknowledged its hybrid academic/activist slant in their proposal, writing, \"… the Program is at once a cultural and educational vehicle for creative awareness, confidence, and determination of Black people.\"  Specifically, the first two years of the degree program would be devoted to \"the decolonization of the mind of the student and the development of interpretive skills necessary to define… the relations between our history as a people and our present situation.\"  The second two years would be focused on acquiring the technical skills that students would need to help the black community – at home, in the Diaspora, and in Africa.  Early in the third quarter (January and February, 1969) the FCC faculty accepted the proposal, thereby creating the Black Studies Department, though the following May, amidst Congressional disapporoval and several firings of FCC administrators, Garrett announced that he was withdrawing the Black Studies proposal.  Calling FCC a \"plantation,\" Garrett stated that staying on campus put the \"minds of black people\" in the hands of Congress.  Determined to claim \"independence,\" he announced that the Black education program would leave FCC and set itself up in the \"community.\"",

The organization advocated for the black owned businesses in the area.  In 1971, for instance, it lead a series of protests demanding that the Redevelopment Land Agency demolish the 100 buildings that had been gutted in the 1968 riot but still stood along 14th, H and 7th Streets.  \"These untended blights have caused many black businesses to die and have caused most of the surviving ones to operate substantially in the red,\" Pitts declared.  Though the organization does not appear in any newspaper coverage after 1971, Pitts would continue this activism through the decade, demanding, in 1975, for instance, that black food venders get a cut of the business for the bicentennial celebration.

The organization grew out of Saturday lunches of about one dozen people at te Potter's House. As the group continually grew residents voted for a community assembly in 1970 and AMO was formed.  In the early years AMO was instrumental in preventing the construction of a BP gas station on 18th and Columbia Road challenging zoning regulations. The organization was also intrumental in preventing the displacement of Seaton Street residents which led the residents to buy their building.  Despite its long standing approach towards resisting gentrification and the development of tenant-friendly legislation, AMO has suffered from a decline in participation, particuarly in African American representation which has negatively affected the organization. The Advisory Neighborhood Council now functions in the capacity of a neighorhood assembly adopting most of AMO's original causes.",
